// Complexity Analysis 

why should we go to there ??

1- Good Programmer - Good programming Practices

/* 

Assuum Tortic Analysis 

it is a procedure to find out the complexity of algorithms 

1- time 
2- space 

*/
/* 
There are there cases while we are working with time and space complexity ananlysis 

1- best 
2- average 
3- Worst

// tabulate the best average worst TCA and CSA of sorting and searching algorithm
